# RAG Chatbot with Company-Specific Data

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot trained on company-specific data. The chatbot uses Pinecone as its vector database for efficient similarity search and implements optimized chunking strategies for improved performance.

## Features

- RAG-based chatbot for company-specific queries
- Integration with Pinecone vector database
- Optimized chunking strategies for better retrieval

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pinecone API key
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-chatbot.git
   cd rag-chatbot
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Pinecone API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export PINECONE_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your company-specific data and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the data processing script to chunk and index your data:
   ```
   python process_data.py
   ```

3. Start the chatbot:
   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries and pressing Enter.

## Chunking Strategies

This project implements optimized chunking strategies to improve the quality of retrieved information. The strategies are documented in detail in the `chunking_strategies.py` file. Key features include:

- Semantic-aware chunking
- Overlap between chunks to maintain context
- Dynamic chunk sizing based on content complexity

For more information on the chunking strategies, please refer to the comments in the `chunking_strategies.py` file.

## Vector Database

We use Pinecone as our vector database for its efficiency in similarity search operations. The integration with Pinecone is handled in the `vector_db.py` file, which includes functions for:

- Initializing the Pinecone index
- Uploading vectors to the index
- Performing similarity searches

## Documentation

All steps of the project, including detailed explanations of the implementation and room for further improvements, have been documented and uploaded as PDF files. These documents can be found in the `docs/` directory of this repository. Please refer to these PDFs for in-depth information on:

- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model architecture and training process
- Chunking strategy implementation details
- Pinecone integration and optimization
- Performance metrics and evaluation results
- Potential areas for future enhancements
